<p>The AI system operates in critical sectors or essential services. The AI system is involved in decision-making impacting opportunities or access to services. Safety-critical components are not integrated into the AI system. The AI system does not play a role in employment or management. The AI system is not used in law enforcement or migration control. The AI system does not contribute to justice or democratic processes. The AI system is not used for remote biometric identification. The AI system meets specific criteria for risk assessment and oversight. The AI system's usage is transparent. AI-generated content is not clearly identifiable. The AI system is primarily used in non-critical applications. The AI system has minimal potential for harm. The AI system's usage is widespread and accepted.</p>
